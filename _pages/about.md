I’m **Andoni Irazusta Garmendia**, a researcher and engineer working on **deep learning systems that learn from experience, adapt at inference time, and act intelligently in complex decision-making settings**.

A large part of my work uses **combinatorial optimization problems (COPs)** as a challenging testbed for these ideas. In that context, I develop end-to-end approaches that combine **representation learning**, **search and decision-making**, and **reinforcement learning**, and I build the full pipeline from **model architectures** and **training objectives** to **evaluation and large-scale experimentation**.

If you’d like a quick overview, check out my **Blog** and **Publications** pages, or reach out via email.

Outside research, I like running and experimenting with performance training.
